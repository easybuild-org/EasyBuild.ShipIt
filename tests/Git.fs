// We can't test all the Git functions, because:
// - getHeadBranchName: we can't garantee the branch name
// - isDirty: we can't garantee the repository is clean
// - getCommits(All): number of commits change over time
// - getCommits(From): number of commits change over time
//
// But we still test some of the function to try minimize the risk of bugs and regressions
